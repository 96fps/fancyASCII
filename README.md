# fancyASCII
A monospaced document formatter.

*\*-ASCII part of the name is a misnomer, as it can make heavy use of monospaced unicode characters.*

## Wait, What?
FancyASCII intends to be many things.
  - a powerful editor for ASCII-Art type documents, with unicode support.
  - a markdown-like document language targetting plaintext monospaced output.
  - a library of ML->ASCII extensions for embedding in documents.
  - a monospaced document viewer and editor.

## FormatTypes
### Math(s)
Formats for many kinds of math, possibly based on courses I took recently.
  - Linear Algebra 
     - matrices
  - Relational Algebra
  - Symbolic Logic
    - Logical Derrivation Trees
  - Sentence diagrams
  
## Rationale
All my class notes are text files. Using a markup language lets the user quickly define complex, odd, or rare elements/structures with a normal keyboard, w\o relying on copy-pasting special symbols.
